# Utilities Branch

Used to keep logic focused non-UI files, such as reusable functions that can be used in components. Helps keep components focused on rendering only.

Like a toolbox for helpers, keeps code modular and testable.

Constants and helpers are typically organized in dedicated files or folders to avoid hardcoding and enhance maintainability, with constants holding fixed values like routes and helpers containing utility functions for tasks like data formatting

## Utilities

- Services: Reusable API calls
- Custom Hooks: Custom react hooks wrapping other react logic
- Constants: Fixed values like routes to avoid hardcoding
- Helpers: Small simple reusable functions
- Tests: Use vitest to test front end code
